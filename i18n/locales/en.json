    "question1": "What sets Rieger Systems apart from other software companies?",
    "answer1": "We don't just develop functional software, but systems with attitude. Our solutions are deliberately clear, transparent, and responsible – without dependencies, without data hunger, but with structure, ethics, and substance.",
    "question2": "Where is Rieger Systems currently in its development?",
    "answer2": "We are in the setup phase, developing our first products – including an AI-powered system for healthcare. Initial partnerships and pilot customers are currently being established.",
    "question3": "Do you offer custom software development?",
    "answer3": "In selected cases, yes. We take on projects if they align with our values and are technologically challenging. We are especially open to collaborations in ethical AI and secure digital infrastructure.",
    "question4": "How do you handle artificial intelligence?",

    "question6": "Is Rieger Systems interesting for small businesses?",
    "answer6": "Absolutely. Especially small businesses often lack secure, scalable tools. Our systems are intentionally modular and fair – so they are accessible even to smaller organizations.",

    "question8": "The easiest way is via our contact form or directly by e-mail.",
    "question9": "Will your software be open source?",
    "answer9": "Parts of it – yes. Especially for infrastructure, interfaces, or ethical components, we aim for open source. Critical core systems with high responsibility will be developed and operated under controlled conditions.",
    "question10": "What does your software cost?",
    "answer10": "Our products are offered modularly – no lock-in, no hidden costs. Prices depend on usage, scope, and license model. For pilot projects, individual agreements apply.",
